### 🌀 who dis?

just a guy who accidentally turned “let me automate this one thing” into 4 side-projects, a startup, and a mild dependency on LangGraph.

I build AI tools so I don’t have to manage my own life.  
It’s going okay (I think? I built a task manager but forgot to use it).

🧃 fueled by caffeine, chaos, and the occasional GitHub contribution graph dopamine hit.

### ⚙️ toolbelt (yes I know it’s a mess)

- **code speak:** Python, JS/TS, C++, SQL (i still google joins)
- **frontend magic:** React, Next.js, Tailwind (aka divs with vibes)
- **backend logic:** FastAPI, Node, Prisma, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **AI wizardry:** OpenAI, LangGraph, Pinecone, RAG, MCP, Embeddings, etc.
- **other stuff:** yeah... I also yell at docker sometimes
